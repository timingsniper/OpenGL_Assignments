Worked on making 7 Hand gestures! (Waving, Rabbit, Fist, 666, OK, Handgun, Railgun feat Misaka Mikoto)  Executables can be found in Hand/bin/x64/Debug.
You can interact with mouse and arrow keys on keyboard to change POV.

# Assignment 2: Still Hand (相机控制)
First requirement was to achieve mouse&keyboard control of POV but that was done last time..
The code here goes with the requirement of rotation with quaternion, but its smooth rotation was not achieved. Mouse and Keyboard control part of the code is commented out, this time with function to change to POV to the center of the hand (0,0,0) when long pressing Z key.

# Assignment 3: Particles (粒子系统和光照明)

Requirement was to render light source+particle system, but only particle system is achieved here. Snowflake particles are created (maximum of 20,000 particles), which live for 5 seconds. Mouse and keyboard controls are still available.

Done for this semester!
